Use the cross_compile script to cross compile rcqp for Windows.

In order to specify the name of the cross compiling tool, you can create a
file named "rcqpcrossrc" in the same directory as the script itself. This file
should contain definitions for the RCQP_CROSS_CC and RCQP_CROSS_HOST
variables. For instance
	RCQP_CROSS_CC=i386-mingw32-gcc
	RCQP_CROSS_HOST=i386-mingw32


The products of the cross-compilations will be written in a directory
specified by the RCQP_CROSS_BASEDIR variable. If it is not specified, the
default value is a directory named "CrossCompilation" located at the same
level as the "Current" directory in the rcqp sources directory.


The cross_compile script can take one optional argument to designate the
target you want to cross compile. Current values are: pcre and rcqp (a
target glib might be added in the future). If no argument is specified, all
the targets are compiled.
For instance:
	./cross_compile rcqp
